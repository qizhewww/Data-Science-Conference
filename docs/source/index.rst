Q&A
--------
- **Who will be attending the conference?**
 
  All DS team will be attended either remotely or in person.

  Anyone who has great content to share with the whole team should consider submitting your proposal.  
  
- **What kind of topics could you present at the conference?**

  The presentation could either be from your Center of Excellent (CoE) works, client use cases, or anything DS-related.   
  
- **What is lightning talk?**

  A `lightning talk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk>`_ is a short `presentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation>`_ lasting only 10 minutes. The goal of lightning talks is to articulate a topic in a quick, insightful, and clear manner.

- **How is the conference different from a knowledge share session?**
  
  DS conference is more than sharing knowledge! For presenters, you with your colleagues. For attendees, you are invited to take one day off from work (who does not want a day off 😉) and join us to find out what other colleagues have explored in the DS-related areas that can be invaluable and further the development of your career journey. Of course, there are tons of socializing opportunities and fun events for team bonding!
